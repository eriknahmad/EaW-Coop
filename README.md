# EaW-Coop
Co-Op Unit Sharing Script for Skirmish mode in STAR WARSâ„¢ Empire at War


# Motivation
I created this script to find out if you can functionally replicate a "transfer units" command from Co-Op RTS games like Halo Wars.


# How to use?
To get Multiplayer Skirmish Co-Op working:
- In the files for your EaW Mod, create a placeholder unit with the example file.
- In Factions.xml, locate the <Land_Skirmish_AI_Default_Forces> XML Tag and integrate the new Starting Forces.
- In MiscObjects.xml insert the <Lua_Script> reference in the Multiplayer Beacon object (Look at example).
- Insert the COOP Lua Script into Data/Scripts/GameObject.
- Run the updated files and start a Multiplayer Skirmish game with your partner.
- Use the Beacon button on the Command Bar to transfer units to your teamate.
