# EaW-Coop
Co-Op Unit Sharing Script for Skirmish mode in STAR WARSâ„¢ Empire at War
</br>Future versions will hopefully eliminate the need for a second faction. (To do this in lua we need an instance of the ally player. This is difficult but a potential solution is to find the teamates units and store the owner using unit.Get_Owner(). We just need a reliable way to get an allied unit)


# Motivation
I created this script to find out if you can functionally replicate a "transfer units" command from Co-Op RTS games like Halo Wars.


# How to use?
To get Multiplayer Skirmish Co-Op working:
- In your EaW Mod, create an ally faction in Factions.xml
- Insert the <Lua_Script> Reference to the Multiplayer Beacon in MiscObjects.xml (Look at example).
- In COOP.lua replace all instances of AllyFaction with your new faction name.
- Run updated files and start a Skirmish game with your partner.
- Use the Beacon button on the Command Bar to transfer units to your teamate.
